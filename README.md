# Hi there 👋 I'm Rainer!
After finishing my doctoral thesis in biology 🌱🐛🔬 I am keen to move towards data science. Scientific and experimental work as well as comprehensive data analysis and statistics were the main focus during my studies. Through the Data Science Bootcamp I could further expand my knowledge and directly apply it in practical projects. I am highly motivated to further expand my knowledge and deep dive into data science.
