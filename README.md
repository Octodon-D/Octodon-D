# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rainer!
To further expand my skills on data processing and analysis, I decided to complete a data science bootcamp straight after finishing my doctoral thesis in molecular ecology (biology). Equipped with an enormous amount of new knowledge and skills in Python and machine learning, I am now ready to dive into the depths of data science.
